A trainer is a program that runs in the background while you play the game and allows you to activate cheats or hacks by pressing certain keys. For example, you can get unlimited gold, honor, and resources, or make your units invincible.

3. Start the game and load your save or start a new campaign or skirmish.
4. Press F1 to activate the trainer. You should hear a sound confirming that the trainer is activated.
