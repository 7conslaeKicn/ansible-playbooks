The film follows Takatoshi Minamiyama (Fukushi), an art student who falls in love at first sight with Emi Fukuju (Komatsu), a mysterious girl he meets on the train. They start dating and enjoy their happy days together, but Emi reveals her secret to him: she lives in a reverse time flow, meaning that she meets him for the first time on his last day with her, and vice versa. As they try to cope with their opposite timelines, they discover the true meaning of love and fate.
 
Tomorrow I Will Date With Yesterday's You is a film that explores the concept of time and its impact on human relationships. The film uses a nonlinear narrative structure that switches between the perspectives of Takatoshi and Emi, creating a sense of confusion and curiosity for the viewers. The film also employs beautiful cinematography and music that enhance the emotional atmosphere of the story.
 
The film is not a typical romance film that focuses on the happy moments of the couple. Instead, it shows the realistic and painful aspects of loving someone who is destined to leave you. The film portrays the struggles and sacrifices that both Takatoshi and Emi have to make in order to cherish their limited time together. The film also raises questions about the nature of destiny and free will, as well as the value of memories and experiences.
